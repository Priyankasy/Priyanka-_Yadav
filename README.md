Hii,
I am currently pursuing my Master of Computer Applications (MCA) at Indira Gandhi University (IGU), where I am developing a strong foundation in computer science, software engineering, and data analysis. I am passionate about leveraging technology to solve real-world problems and continuously improving my skills in programming, algorithms, and data-driven decision-making.
With a keen interest in learning the latest trends in technology, including data analytics, IoT, and AI, I am looking forward to building a career in software development or data analysis. I thrive in team environments and enjoy collaborating on projects that bring innovative solutions to life.
I am open to internships and entry-level opportunities in the tech industry, where I can apply my skills and grow further as a profession.
